### Implementation Plan
This plan outlines the development phases, timeline, and deliverables, ensuring a structured approach. It includes:
- **Development Phases**: POC validates feasibility (e.g., FIRS API integration), Prototype demonstrates core features, and MVP delivers a usable product, reflecting the phased rollout strategy in the FIRS document.
- **Timeline**: A 6-month schedule with POC in Month 1, Prototype in Months 2-3, and MVP in Months 4-6, using 2-week sprints for agility, suitable for a small team.
- **Milestones**: Specific goals like setting up the environment, integrating with FIRS sandbox, and deploying to staging are defined, ensuring progress tracking.
- **Roles and Responsibilities**: Assumes a solo developer handling all roles, with potential for designer and tester in a small team, reflecting the startup context.
- **Deliverables**: Includes code repositories, documentation, and deployed environments for each phase, ensuring traceability and usability.
